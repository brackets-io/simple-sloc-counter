JS Lines of Code Counter (SLOC) for Brackets
============================================
Counts the number of JavaScript files, lines, and lines of code (excluding whitespace/comments) in your project. You can exclude
third-party code such as jQuery by specifying file / folder names.

To get started, just choose _View > Lines of Code Count_.

Due to JS regular expression syntax being insane, in rare cases the counter can't be sure whether code is a comment or not.
In these cases the file will be omitted from the count and you'll see a warning message.

How to Install
